# Changelog

Version numbers are composed of three components, i.e. major.minor.patch.
As a rough guideline, patch releases are just for fixing bugs or adding minor details, minor releases change slightly
larger parts of the library or add significant new functionality.
Major releases fundamentally shift how the library is used and indicate stability.
Since we are not ready for the 1.0 release yet, this does not matter right now.
